ðŸš€ **Introducing my latest Python project: The Tip Calculator!** ðŸ’¸

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly tool that quickly computes tips based on the bill amount, desired tip percentage, and the number of people splitting the bill.

Concepts Used:
1. Input Handling: The program prompts the user for input (bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people).
2. Mathematical Calculations: It performs calculations to determine the total tip amount and the bill per person.
3. Rounding: The final bill per person is rounded to two decimal places.

Features:
- Efficiency: No more manual tip calculationsâ€”let the calculator handle it!
- Precision: Accurate results with rounded amounts.
- User-Friendly: Simple prompts make it accessible to everyone.

Output Example:
Suppose the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with a 12% tip:
- Each person should pay: **$33.60**
